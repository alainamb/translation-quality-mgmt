Quality reviews are scheduled after common production tasks within translation and localization workflows as a check to ensure that the developing product meets the minimum quality standards for that stage, and to prevent unnecessary downstream issues and losses related to rework becoming necessary. The issues and expectations-exceeding performance that quality reviewers flag help quality managers understand where to encourage good performance and where to focus root-cause analysis to prevent issues, and root-cause analyses help project managers optimize processes and resources to build high performing productions over time.
